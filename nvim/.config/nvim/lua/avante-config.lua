-- Absolutely. Here's a crisp, motivating, and professionally written documentation for your `(`-based keymap setup ‚Äî designed not only to teach you the keys but to help you **think like your tools** do üß†‚öôÔ∏è:

--
-- ## üß≠ Avante Keymap Documentation ‚Äî `(`: The Whispering Commander
--
-- ---
--
-- ### ‚ú® Philosophy: One Key to Guide Them All
--
-- In this setup, the **`(` key becomes your personal command whisperer**. It doesn't scream like a `<leader>`, it doesn‚Äôt try to dominate your muscle memory like `<Space>`. Instead, it gently invites action with precision and purpose.
--
-- **You don‚Äôt need to remember everything. You need to *recognize* patterns.**
--
-- This mapping isn‚Äôt designed for memorization‚Äîit‚Äôs built for *intuition*. Over time, your fingers will start to guess the right command without even thinking. And that‚Äôs when you know: the tool is no longer a tool. It‚Äôs part of your thought.
--
-- ---
--
-- ### üß† Base Mnemonics
--
-- | Command | Mapping | Meaning |
-- |--------|--------|---------|
-- | `(`    | **Initiator** | Start any command ‚Äì like saying ‚Äúgo‚Äù |
-- | `a`    | Accept | Accept suggestion or apply |
-- | `o/t`  | Ours/Theirs | Pick sides during code conflict |
-- | `b`    | Both | Merge the best of both worlds |
-- | `n/p`  | Next/Prev | Navigate forward/backward |
-- | `x`    | Cancel | Exit, escape, dismiss |
-- | `@`    | Add | Introduce new file |
-- | `q`    | Quit | Leave the current view or operation |
--
-- ---
--
-- ### üöÄ Suggestion Mode
--
-- | Action           | Key         | Insight |
-- |------------------|-------------|---------|
-- | Accept           | `(a)`       | Confirms the AI's suggestion |
-- | Next Suggestion  | `(n)`       | Skips to the next |
-- | Previous         | `(p)`       | Back to the earlier one |
-- | Dismiss          | `(x)`       | Hide what's irrelevant |
--
-- _**Insight:** Accept when it's useful. Dismiss when it's noise. Navigate with grace._
--
-- ---
--
-- ### üß® Diff Conflict Resolution
--
-- | Action           | Key         | Description |
-- |------------------|-------------|-------------|
-- | Accept Ours      | `(o)`       | Keep your code over theirs |
-- | Accept Theirs    | `(t)`       | Use the incoming changes |
-- | Accept All Theirs| `(at)`      | Surrender it all to their changes |
-- | Merge Both       | `(b)`       | Be diplomatic; take everything |
-- | Apply at Cursor  | `(c)`       | Focus and resolve at your caret |
-- | Next/Prev Hunk   | `)]` / `([` | Jump to the next/previous conflict |
--
-- _**Optimism:** Resolving conflicts doesn‚Äôt have to be chaos. With this structure, it‚Äôs almost surgical._
--
-- ---
--
-- ### üß≠ Navigation + Sidebar
--
-- | Action                  | Key         | Function |
-- |-------------------------|-------------|----------|
-- | Jump to Next AI Marker  | `(j)`       | Find where AI wants attention |
-- | Jump to Previous        | `(J)`       | Go backward in context |
-- | Apply All Changes       | `(A)`       | Accept and move forward confidently |
-- | Apply at Cursor         | `(a)`       | Precise fix |
-- | Retry Request           | `(r)`       | Ask again, maybe clearer |
-- | Edit Prompt             | `(e)`       | Change the input, reframe the question |
-- | Add File to Sidebar     | `(@)`       | Pull in more files |
-- | Remove File             | `(d)`       | Let go of what‚Äôs no longer needed |
-- | Switch Windows          | `(<Tab>)`   | Navigate sidebar views |
--
-- ---
--
-- ### üí¨ Submission & Cancellation
--
-- | Mode        | Action        | Key         |
-- |-------------|---------------|-------------|
-- | Normal Mode | Submit        | `(<CR>)`    |
-- | Insert Mode | Submit        | `(<C-s>)`   |
-- | Cancel      | Escape/Quit   | `(<Esc>)`, `(q)` |
--
-- _**Insight:** You are always in control. Canceling doesn‚Äôt mean quitting‚Äîit means choosing when and how you engage._
--
-- ---
--
-- ## üå± Final Thought: Grow Into It
--
-- This isn‚Äôt just a keymap. It‚Äôs a **language between you and the machine**. You‚Äôre not pressing keys‚Äîyou‚Äôre directing intelligence. Start slow, expect friction, but trust this: **your brain loves patterns**.
--
-- Soon `(a)` won‚Äôt just mean *"accept"*, it will mean *"I trust this enough to move forward."*
--
-- And that‚Äôs not just coding.
--
-- That‚Äôs power. üëäüí°
